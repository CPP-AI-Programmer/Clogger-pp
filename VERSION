# This File is used as another place to store the git commit history
# Future Updates:
#  make this logger library more accessible by chaning into a pure C class that just needs a stack to run (for embedded systems and future projects)
#  make the std library use case optional (create custom buffer class, move std::string and std::vector<T> operator<< functions to another file optionally added compiled using options)
#  update the options to also control what .hpp/.h files are installed
